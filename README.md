# PROJECT: RESTAURANT PAGE

### Brief Introduction
In this fifth repository from The Odin Project Full Stack JavaScript curriculum under the JavaScript course, I will make a Restaurant Page using JavaScript ES6 Module and webpack, HTML, and CSS.


### Learning goal
- To use what I've learn from ES6 module and webpack.
- To continue practicing DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering a simple restaurant homepage.
- To use JavaScript alone to generate the entire contents of the website.


## Reflection/Outcome
Building this Restaurant Page using the JavaScript ES6 module and webpack was fun and challenging.
